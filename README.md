I currently work at [UP42](http://up42.com) as a geospatial python engineer.

My job is to make remote sensing accessible to anyone. Interoperability and transparency with STAC, STAC API and cloud-native solutions.

In the past I worked on:
- :satellite: collecting and extracting weekly water extent for thousands of dams in drought prone northeast Brazil
- :umbrella: a medium range drought forecasting tool and published its results on [HESS](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/22/5041/2018/)

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about geospatial and python.
